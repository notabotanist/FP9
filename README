--

The Parsing.lhs file is unmodified but included due to dependencies by other
modules.

The SKI.lhs file contains the SKI parser, extended with the required additional
"machine instructions" for things like if, then, else, and arithmetic and
comparition operations. Additionally, part (f) at the bottom of the file lists
required examples of these additiont.

The ML.lhs file contains a parser which has been extended to produce SExpr
results, rather than just accepting or rejecting the language.

The Main.lhs file is very short and simply accepts a string and glues together
the other parsers to produce a result.
